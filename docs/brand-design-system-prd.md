# PRD: River Romney Brand Design System

**Author:** River Romney
**Status:** Active — v2 (Agentic)
**Created:** 2026-04-06
**Last updated:** 2026-06-11

> **Note (v2).** This PRD was written for v1: a token-only system consumed by
> copying CSS, with components, an MCP server, and CI/CD all listed as non-goals.
> The system has since grown past that scope on purpose — see the new
> [Agentic System (v2)](#agentic-system-v2--delivered) section and the
> [decision log](decisions.md) for the choices that reversed those non-goals.
> v1 sections below are kept as the historical record; v2 additions are marked.

## Problem Statement

River Romney maintains a growing network of personal sites — riverromney.com (splash), riverromney.design (portfolio), a future riverromney.art (photography/video), and eventually riverromney.blog (writing). Each site was built independently, and while they share the same visual DNA today (fonts, colors, dark theme), there is no shared infrastructure enforcing that consistency. Design values are hardcoded in each site's CSS, meaning every change requires manual propagation across repos. Worse, when AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor) generate UI for any of these sites, they fabricate plausible-looking values instead of using the correct ones — because no machine-readable spec exists.

As the number of sites grows and AI-assisted development becomes the primary workflow, this gap will compound. The cost is visual drift between properties, wasted time re-specifying the same constraints each session, and accessibility regressions that go unnoticed.

## Goals

1. **Single source of truth** — All design decisions (color, typography, spacing, borders, elevation, motion) are defined once and consumed by every site, eliminating manual propagation.
2. **AI-readable by default** — Any Claude Code or Cursor session working on any River Romney site automatically loads the correct design constraints without the user re-explaining them.
3. **WCAG AA compliant** — Every text/background color pairing in the system meets a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Accessibility is enforced at the token level, not audited after the fact.
4. **Multi-site theming** — Support per-site overrides (e.g., pure black background for .art, larger body type for .blog, fintech palette for decisioning-table) without duplicating the shared foundation.
5. **Standards-aligned** — Follow the W3C Design Tokens Community Group spec (DTCG 2025.10) so the system is interoperable with Figma, Tokens Studio, Style Dictionary, and future tooling.

## Non-Goals (v1 — most since reversed in v2)

> Every non-goal below except Tokens Studio sync was deliberately reversed once
> agents became the primary consumer. See the [decision log](decisions.md).

- ~~**Component library**~~ → **Delivered (v2).** 18 framework-agnostic Lit web
  components (`rr-*`), wired to Figma via Code Connect; three carry a full
  machine-readable contract.
- **Figma integration**: Partially delivered — Code Connect maps every component.
  Full Tokens Studio variable sync is still a follow-on project.
- ~~**Custom MCP server**~~ → **Delivered (v2).** An MCP server
  (`list_components`, `get_component`, `check_usage`) is the headline interface.
  The v1 assumption ("a DESIGN.md is sufficient at this scale") was abandoned
  because the agent, not a person, became the main reader.
- ~~**Build pipeline automation**~~ → **Delivered (v2).** CI runs validate →
  build → artifact-staleness → tests on every push; tokens publish as a versioned
  npm package.

## User Stories

### As the site owner / developer

- As the site owner, I want all my sites to share the same visual identity so that visitors experience a coherent brand across riverromney.com, .design, .art, and .blog.
- As the site owner, I want to change a design value (e.g., accent color) in one place and have it propagate to all sites so that I don't spend time making the same edit four times.
- As the site owner, I want per-site overrides for specific contexts (photo-optimized background for .art, reading-optimized type for .blog, fintech aesthetic for decisioning-table) so that shared doesn't mean identical.
- As the site owner, I want every color pairing to meet WCAG AA so that accessibility is a guarantee, not a manual check.

### As an AI coding agent

- As an AI agent working on any River Romney site, I want to read the complete design system spec at session start so that I produce on-brand output without the user re-explaining constraints.
- As an AI agent, I want an enumerated list of every allowed token value so that I pick from the system instead of fabricating values.
- As an AI agent, I want explicit guardrails (what NOT to do) so that I avoid common mistakes like using the accent color for resting text or inventing font weights.

## Requirements

### Must-Have (P0) — Complete

**P0-1: DTCG-format token files** ✅
Define all design values as JSON tokens following the W3C DTCG Format Module (2025.10). Tokens are organized in a three-tier architecture: primitives, semantic, and brand overrides.

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] `primitives/color.tokens.json` defines the full color palette with `$type: "color"` and `$value` for each
- [x] `primitives/typography.tokens.json` defines font families, weights, sizes, and line-heights
- [x] `primitives/spacing.tokens.json` defines the 11-value base-4 spacing scale
- [x] `primitives/radius.tokens.json` defines the border radius scale (none through full)
- [x] `primitives/shadow.tokens.json` defines elevation shadows using DTCG composite shadow type
- [x] `primitives/motion.tokens.json` defines durations and easing curves (cubicBezier type)
- [x] `semantic/color.tokens.json` maps intent-based names (background.default, foreground.primary, foreground.action) to primitive aliases using `{reference}` syntax
- [x] `semantic/typography.tokens.json` defines title, body, and label composite tokens
- [x] All `$value`, `$type`, and `$description` fields conform to DTCG spec
- [x] Token names use semantic naming (color.background.default, not color.dark-green)

**P0-2: WCAG AA contrast compliance** ✅
Every semantic text/background pairing must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum for normal text).

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] color.foreground.primary (#C8CFC4) on color.background.default (#0A0D0A): 12.26:1 — passes
- [x] color.foreground.secondary (#A0A89A) on color.background.default (#0A0D0A): 7.97:1 — passes
- [x] color.foreground.muted (#8B9683) on color.background.default (#0A0D0A): 6.32:1 — passes
- [x] color.foreground.accent (#4ADE6E) on color.background.default (#0A0D0A): 11.13:1 — passes AAA
- [x] color.foreground.on-action (#0A0D0A) on color.background.action (#4ADE6E): 11.13:1 — passes AAA
- [x] White (#FFFFFF) on color.background.action (#4ADE6E): 1.76:1 — fails AA (documented, not used)
- [x] Contrast ratios are documented in the token `$description` fields

**P0-3: AI-readable DESIGN.md** ✅
A markdown file describing the complete visual system in prose, structured for LLM consumption.

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] Covers: visual identity, color tokens (with CSS variable names and hex values), typography (families, weights, roles), spacing scale, and guardrails
- [x] Guardrails explicitly state: no fabricating values, accent is hover-only for resting text, AA minimum, allowed font weights
- [x] File is concise enough to fit within a typical LLM context window (~2K tokens)
- [x] References the DTCG token files as the canonical source

**P0-4: CLAUDE.md integration** ✅

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] CLAUDE.md exists at repo root
- [x] Uses `@ai/DESIGN.md` import syntax to load the design spec
- [x] Any Claude Code session in the repo has full design context without user intervention

**P0-5: CSS custom property output** ✅
Style Dictionary v4 compiles the DTCG tokens into CSS custom properties that each site can consume.

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] Running the build produces `build/css/variables.css` with all semantic tokens as `--color-*`, `--font-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--duration-*`, `--easing-*` custom properties
- [x] Output CSS is valid and directly consumable by static HTML, Hugo, and React/Vite sites
- [ ] Per-site override files (variables-art.css, variables-blog.css) are generated when brand override tokens exist

**P0-6: Brand token repository** ✅

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] Repo exists at github.com/digital2analogue/brand-tokens
- [x] Contains: `tokens/`, `ai/`, `build/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `package.json`, Style Dictionary config
- [x] README explains repo purpose, structure, and how to consume tokens in a site

### Nice-to-Have (P1)

**P1-1: Per-site brand override tokens** (partial)
Override files for .art and .blog that modify specific tokens while inheriting everything else.

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] `tokens/brands/dot-art.tokens.json` overrides background to #000000
- [x] `tokens/brands/dot-blog.tokens.json` overrides body typography to 18px / 1.7 line-height
- [ ] Overrides produce separate CSS output files via Style Dictionary
- [ ] Decisioning-table brand override file created with fintech palette

**P1-2: CSS linter / audit rule** ✅ (delivered v2)
A lint rule that flags any hardcoded color, primitive reference, or hardcoded font size. Lives once in `scripts/rules.mjs` and is imported by the build gate (`validate`), the MCP `check_usage` tool, and the consumer `drift-lint` scan.

Acceptance criteria:

- [x] Running the linter against a file reports any hardcoded hex, `--primitive-*` reference, hardcoded font size, or deprecated token
- [~] Rules are defined once and shared by every checker (regex rule set rather than an auto-generated allowlist; same single-source intent)

**P1-3: llms.txt for external AI tools**
A lightweight llms.txt file at the design system's documentation URL for non-Claude AI tools to discover the system.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] `/llms.txt` provides a structured overview of the design system (~5K tokens)
- [ ] Includes links to full documentation for tools that want deeper context

**P1-4: Contrast ratio documentation page**
A generated reference showing every text/background pairing with its contrast ratio, pass/fail status, and visual preview.

Acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Auto-generated from token files (not manually maintained)
- [ ] Shows each semantic text color against each semantic background
- [ ] Clearly labels WCAG AA and AAA compliance for each pairing

### AI-Native & Presentation (P1, added 2026-05-29)

*Context: Following review of Peter Nowell's DesignerPunk.ai — what to steal from his packaging and what to adapt for River's positioning.*

**P1-6: AI agent validation demo**
Build a demonstrable proof that an LLM prompted to generate UI using the token system produces correct, on-brand output. The most compelling portfolio artifact — shows the system works, not just that it exists.

- [ ] Create 2–3 test prompts ("build a card component", "create a hero section", "generate a contact form") exercising color, typography, and spacing tokens
- [ ] Run each in a Claude Code session with CLAUDE.md / DESIGN.md context loaded
- [ ] Capture: prompt → generated code → rendered screenshot
- [ ] Document corrections needed (target: zero) — validates the AI-readability layer
- [ ] Package as case study content showing the workflow end-to-end

**P1-7: AI-readability architecture doc**
Document the architectural decisions behind making the system AI-readable — why DTCG, why intent descriptions in `$description` fields, why the `ai/` folder structure, how it differs from traditional documentation. Portfolio talking point and Substack content.

- [ ] Covers: machine-readable tokens, intent descriptions, CLAUDE.md import pattern, `agents/` prompt scaffolds
- [ ] Explains tradeoffs vs. alternatives (MCP server, Figma-only, custom tooling)
- [ ] Under 1000 words, presentable in a portfolio review
- [ ] Saved as `docs/ai-readability-decisions.md`

**P1-8: Cross-platform token output (research spike)**
Document how the DTCG + Style Dictionary setup extends to iOS/Swift and Android/Kotlin output. Research only — know the path well enough to discuss credibly in interviews and consulting.

- [ ] How Style Dictionary v4 transforms handle multi-platform output from DTCG source
- [ ] Compare with alternatives (unitless math-based like DesignerPunk's Rosetta, Theo, custom transforms)
- [ ] What would change in current token structure (likely nothing — `$type` handles this)
- [ ] Saved as `docs/cross-platform-tokens-research.md`

**P1-9: Quantifiable stats for portfolio case study**
Surface the system's real numbers in the case study page. Numbers read as credibility; descriptions read as claims.

- [ ] Compile stats: token counts (primitive, semantic, component), component count, test count, contrast ratios documented, drift audit score, consuming properties
- [ ] Design a compact stats display for the portfolio case study (fits riverromney.design aesthetic)
- [ ] Keep stats derivable from source (not hardcoded numbers that drift)

**P1-10: Named subsystem framing**
Give the system's natural modules names and one-sentence descriptions. Changes perception from "a repo with folders" to a considered architecture.

Subsystems already exist:
- Token architecture — three-tier DTCG primitives → semantic → brand overrides
- AI-readability layer — DESIGN.md, rules.md, CLAUDE.md imports, agents/ scaffolds
- Governance / drift detection — drift_audit.py, contrast validation, rules enforcement
- Component library — LitElement web components, React CE support, Figma Code Connect
- Build pipeline — Style Dictionary v4 → per-brand CSS → sync-tokens to consumers

- [ ] Choose names for each subsystem (plain-language or with personality — not cyberpunk)
- [ ] One-sentence responsibility description per subsystem
- [ ] Use names consistently in case study, README, and presentations
- [ ] Architecture diagram showing subsystem relationships (mermaid or SVG in repo)

**P1-11: Narrative case study structure**
Extract the story from this PRD into a portfolio-ready case study page. Problem Statement + Goals + Architecture already contain 80% of the narrative.

- [ ] Structure: Challenge → Insight → Approach → Results
- [ ] Challenge = manual propagation, AI fabricating values, accessibility regressions
- [ ] Insight = why tokens + AI-readability solves it differently than traditional docs
- [ ] Approach = architecture decisions and what makes them distinctive
- [ ] Results = validation demo (P1-6), stats (P1-9), before/after evidence
- [ ] Written in River's voice (concrete anchor, no thesis-first, land on an image)
- [ ] Lives on riverromney.design as a case study page

**P1-12: Structured governance rules with IDs**
Upgrade the rule set from informal guardrails to named, scoped rules with enforcement mechanisms. Reads as infrastructure, not documentation. (Partially delivered by `scripts/rules.mjs` — rules now have `id` fields and are shared across checkers; the remaining work is scoping and drift-report rule-ID references.)

- [ ] Each rule: ID (e.g., `DRIFT-001`), name, scope, rule text, enforcement mechanism
- [ ] Cover: no hardcoded colors, no hardcoded spacing, semantic-only in consuming code, accent usage, font weight restrictions
- [ ] Format is human-readable and AI-parseable
- [ ] Drift tooling output references rule IDs so violations map to specific rules

### Future Considerations (P2)

**P2-1: Light theme**
The architecture supports light themes via the brand override layer. The decisioning-table app already uses a light mode palette (warm off-white backgrounds, dark text, darker accent green for contrast). Formalizing this as a theme token set is a natural next step.

**P2-2: Figma variable sync**
Connect the DTCG tokens to Figma via Tokens Studio. This enables visual design in Figma that stays in sync with the code tokens, and unlocks Figma's MCP server for AI-powered design-to-code workflows.

**P2-3: Component tokens (Tier 3)** ✅ (delivered v2)
Scoped tokens like `component-badge-success-background` now exist in `tokens/components/`, consumed by the matching `rr-*` component. Semantic spacing categories (inset/stack/inline/section/page) remain primitive-based for now.

**P2-4: CI/CD pipeline** ✅ (delivered v2)
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs validate → build → build:meta → artifact-staleness → tests on every push. Tokens publish as a versioned npm package via `publish.yml`. Auto-build-on-token-change for consumers is the next step (see drift detection in the v2 section).

**P2-5: Design system documentation site**
A dedicated site (e.g., system.riverromney.design) documenting the token taxonomy, usage guidelines, and component patterns. This is where the llms.txt (P1-3) would live.

## Agentic System (v2) — delivered

v1 assumed the main reader was a person and the main risk was manual
propagation. v2 started from a different premise: the main reader is an **agent**,
and the system should be **enforceable as data**, not just documented in prose.
The choices that got it there are in the [decision log](decisions.md); the
summary:

- **Components as contracts.** 18 Lit web components ship with an auto-generated
  Custom Elements Manifest; three add a hand-authored `meta.json` (tokens, rules,
  a11y). Merged deterministically into `design-system.json`.
- **One agent interface (MCP).** `list_components`, `get_component`,
  `check_usage` read that artifact. `check_usage` lets an agent lint a snippet
  *before* it writes UI.
- **One rule set, three checkers.** `scripts/rules.mjs` is imported by the build
  gate, the MCP, and the consumer drift scan — they cannot disagree.
- **Versioned distribution.** Built CSS ships as `@digital2analogue2/tokens` on
  public npm; consumers add a dependency instead of hand-copying.
- **Governance moved upstream.** The same rules that fail the build are the ones
  an agent gets from `check_usage`, so violations are caught before code exists.

### v2 — Still open

- **Self-healing drift loop** (in progress): the drift scan runs in CI and opens
  a PR/issue when a consumer drifts. Auto-fix (codemod) is deferred.
- **Full contract on all 18 components**: the richer `meta.json` is on three so
  far; the CEM covers the rest.
- **Consumer migration onto the published package**: the portfolio
  (riverromney.design) now consumes `@digital2analogue2/tokens` instead of an
  inlined block — the system dogfoods its own distribution. Remaining sites
  (.com, .art, .blog, decision-engine) still to move as they come online.
- **MCP expansion** (planned, 2026-06-11): grow the server from 3 lookup tools
  to ~11 — token awareness (`get_token`, `find_token`, `get_spacing`), design
  reasoning (`get_rule`, `get_decision`, `check_assembly`), and brand-aware
  tools (`get_brand`, `compare_brands`) — so external agents without the repo
  checked out can reason with the system, not just query it. Spec:
  [`mcp-expansion-prd.md`](mcp-expansion-prd.md); rationale in the
  [decision log](decisions.md).

| space.md | 16px | Default padding, standard gap |
| space.lg | 24px | Card padding, comfortable spacing |
| space.xl | 32px | Section padding, grid gaps |
| space.2xl | 48px | Section margins, layout gaps |
| space.3xl | 64px | Large section breaks |

| radius.sm | 4px | Subtle rounding — inputs, small elements |
| radius.md | 8px | Buttons, menus, selects |
| radius.lg | 12px | Cards, panels |
| radius.xl | 16px | Prominent rounding — modals, hero cards |
| radius.full | 9999px | Pills, badges, circles |

### Shadow / Elevation (Primitives)

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| shadow.none | none | Flat elements |
| shadow.sm | 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) | Subtle lift — inputs, dropdowns |
| shadow.md | 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12) | Cards, toolbars |
| shadow.lg | 0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.16) | Modals, menus, popovers |
| shadow.xl | 0 12px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.24) | Dialogs, toasts |

### Motion (Primitives)

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| duration.fast | 120ms | Hover states, color transitions |
| duration.normal | 200ms | Expand/collapse, menus |
| duration.slow | 350ms | Page transitions, modals |
| easing.default | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) | General-purpose (ease) |
| easing.in | cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1) | Elements exiting |
| easing.out | cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1) | Elements entering |
| easing.in-out | cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1) | Elements moving |

### How Sites Consume Tokens

Each site copies the compiled CSS into its assets. The site's own CSS uses custom properties instead of hardcoded values:

```css
body {
  background: var(--color-background-default);
  color: var(--color-foreground-primary);
  font: var(--font-body-large);
}

a {
  color: var(--color-foreground-action);
}

a:hover {
  color: var(--color-foreground-accent);
}

.button {
  background: var(--color-background-action);
  color: var(--color-foreground-on-action);
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
  padding: var(--space-xs) var(--space-md);
  transition: background-color var(--duration-fast) var(--easing-default);
}
```

For v1, the consumption model is copying `variables.css` into each site's assets directory. This can be upgraded to npm/submodule later.

For themed projects (like decisioning-table), the approach is to import the base token CSS then override specific tokens in a local overrides file. This way the project inherits the full system and only maintains the delta.

## Success Metrics

### Leading (within 2 weeks of implementation)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Token coverage | 100% of color, font, and spacing values in .com and .design are expressed as custom properties referencing the shared token set | Manual audit of both sites' CSS |
| AI accuracy | Claude Code sessions produce on-brand output without manual correction for color/font/spacing values | Qualitative — track over 5 sessions |
| WCAG compliance | 0 contrast violations across all semantic text/background pairings | Automated contrast check against token file |

### Lagging (within 2 months)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Propagation time | Design change takes <5 min to apply across all sites (down from ~30 min manual) | Time from token edit to all sites updated |
| New site velocity | Standing up riverromney.art with correct branding takes <1 hour of styling work | Track actual time during .art buildout |
| Drift incidents | 0 instances of hardcoded values bypassing the token system | CSS lint report (when P1-2 is implemented) |

## Resolved Questions

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| 1 | Should accent (#4ADE6E) ever be used as resting text? | Yes, via semantic tokens: foreground.accent for emphasis, foreground.action for links. Contrast ratio (11.13:1) supports this. |
| 2 | Should the spacing scale be hardcoded or derived from a formula? | Hardcoded base-4 grid with 11 values. Compared against Material Design 3's 4dp grid — our scale is more selective (skips every-4dp steps between 24-48) since web layouts need less granularity than mobile UI. |
| 3 | How should the .blog site consume tokens on Substack? | Deferred — .blog is future work. Substack allows custom CSS in paid plans. |
| 4 | Should JetBrains Mono be included in v1? | Yes — included as a primitive. Currently used by the decisioning-table app. |
| 5 | What's the preferred consumption model? | Direct copy of variables.css for v1. Sites maintain their own copy. Upgrade to npm/submodule when the overhead of manual copy becomes painful. (v2: upgraded — `@digital2analogue2/tokens` on public npm.) |
| 9 | Should the MCP server grow beyond the 3 lookup tools? | Yes — unfrozen 2026-06-11 for external-agent consumption. The earlier freeze rationale (always-on context suffices) still holds *internally*; the expansion targets agents without the repo checked out. See `docs/mcp-expansion-prd.md` and the decision log. |

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Owner | Blocking? |
|---|----------|-------|-----------|
| 6 | Should semantic spacing tokens (inset, stack, inline, section, page) be added? | Design | No — primitives are sufficient for now. Revisit when usage patterns emerge across 3+ sites. |
| 7 | Should the decisioning-table fintech theme live in brand-tokens as a brand override, or locally in the decisioning-table repo? | Design | No — local override is fine for now. Promote to brand-tokens if reused. |
| 8 | Should opacity tokens be added for disabled states and overlays? | Design | No — low priority until a component library exists. |

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (complete):** Created the repo, wrote DESIGN.md + CLAUDE.md, defined primitive and semantic token JSON files.
- **Phase 2 (complete):** Added Style Dictionary config, generated CSS output, integrated into .com and .design repos. Added border radius, shadow, and motion primitives. Renamed color semantics to background/foreground convention. Added action color tokens.
- **Phase 3 (complete):** Decisioning-table atomic design refactor and brand-token integration. Validated the override architecture with a themed project.
- **Phase 4 (complete):** Shared CSS lint rules (`rules.mjs`), the validate build gate, and four brand override outputs.
- **Phase 5 (complete) — Agentic:** Lit component library + Custom Elements Manifest, hand-authored `meta.json` contracts, `design-system.json`, the MCP server, Figma Code Connect, and versioned npm distribution. See the [Agentic System (v2)](#agentic-system-v2--delivered) section.
- **Phase 6 (in progress):** Self-healing drift detection in CI; richer contracts on the remaining components; migrating consumers onto the published package.
- **Phase 7 (future):** Validate brand override architecture with .art. Tokens Studio / Figma variable sync.
