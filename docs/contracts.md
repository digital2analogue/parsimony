Parsimony is moving to a **contract-authoritative** model: each component's
`*.meta.json` is evolving into the single machine-readable definition — props with
dual code↔Figma bindings, slot constraints, (later) per-part anatomy — and both
surfaces (Lit code, Figma library) are provable against it. Two rules carry the
whole model:

1. **Surfaces never sync side-to-side.** A drift between code and Figma is resolved
   by promoting the change *into the contract* as a reviewed diff, then bringing the
   lagging surface up to it — never by eyeballing one surface against the other.
2. **No capability claim without an eval behind it.** Every gate and detector below
   has synthetic-fixture tests (`tests/unit/`); a rule added without its fixture
   pair fails the suite.

## The pieces

| Piece | Where | What it declares |
|---|---|---|
| **Prop bindings** | `props[].bindings` in `*.meta.json` | `{ code: { prop }, figma: { kind, property, valueMap? } }` — how one code prop maps to a Figma variant axis and its options. Boolean derivations supported (`State=disabled → disabled: true`). |
| **Design-only options** | `figma.ignoredOptions` in `*.meta.json` | Figma variant options that deliberately emit no code (e.g. button `State=hover` — CSS handles it). Declared, so they are covered — anything *undeclared* and unbound is drift. |
| **Slot constraints** | `slots[].accepts` in `*.meta.json` | Element tags a slot accepts (`rr-menu` default slot → `rr-menu-item`). Omitted = unconstrained; `"*"` = explicitly anything; `"#text"` = text-only. |
| **Anatomy** | `anatomy` in `*.meta.json` | A named part tree; each part binds semantic tokens for `background` / `foreground` / `border` / `spacing` / `font` / `radius` / `shadow` / `motion` / `focus`, with `states` overlays (`variant=success`, `disabled`, `:hover`, or several ANDed). Transcribed from the component's real styles, never inferred. Feeds per-part contrast — see below. |
| **The dump** | `figma/components.dump.json` | Snapshot of the Figma component sets (variant symbol names per bound component), exported from the Parsimony Design System file (`4aOEBHcnAv2Kbn0g1arL78`) via the Figma MCP. Input to the parity differ. Never hand-edit. |

Roll-out is **opt-in per component**: gates only fire on metas that declare bindings.
Currently bound: `rr-badge`, `rr-button`, `rr-input` (the three `stable` components).
The other 24 metas get promoted as #156 stages roll through them.

**One gate is not opt-in.** §4d (contract ↔ styles, #187) runs on all 27: a component
either authors `tokensUsed` or derives it from an anatomy (#188), so every component has a
token contract to check and there is nothing to opt into. Before it
existed, `tokensUsed` was checked against *nothing*: its only reader was the doc
generator, so it could name a token the component had stopped using, or miss one it
had started using, indefinitely. Anatomy has the same exposure by construction — it
is transcribed from real styles by hand — which is why this landed before #179–#183
promote anatomy across the remaining components rather than after.

The gate reports three things, all mechanical:

- **unknown** — a `var(--x)` naming nothing the token store defines and nothing the
  component's own directory declares. A typo, or a rename that wasn't propagated.
  Local knobs are collected per *directory*, not per file: `rr-table` declares the
  padding custom properties `rr-table-cell` consumes.
- **behind** — the styles use a token the contract never declares.
- **ahead** — the contract declares a token the styles never reference.

Primitives are excluded and left to the no-primitive lint rule — reporting one here
would tell an author to add it to `tokensUsed`, which the schema forbids outright.

## Anatomy and contrast

Declared per-part pairings are a **third source** of intended fg/bg pairs, alongside the
naming convention and the explicit map (`tokens/pairings.json`). `npm run validate` §5,
`validate_brand`, and `check_contrast` all read the union.

Anatomy's contribution is deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is what keeps it honest:

- **Text pairs only.** A part's `border` is compared against nothing — a badge's border
  equals its own fill, and the surrounding surface isn't knowable from the contract.
  Non-text (SC 1.4.11) edges stay in `tokens/pairings.json`.
- **Both sides on the same part.** No inheriting a background from an ancestor.
- **`disabled` states are exempt** (WCAG exempts disabled controls).
- **`excludeBrands` wins.** A pair the map scopes out of a brand is dropped from the merged
  set no matter which source named it — including anatomy. Scoping a pair out has to mean
  the brand isn't checked on it, or the escape hatch is a lie. (It matters concretely:
  `rr-badge`'s accent variants declare exactly the four accent-tint pairs decision-engine
  is excluded from.)

`check_contrast` also takes `{ component, part, state? }` instead of two colours, resolving
the pair from the contract — the way to ask "what does this component actually put together
under this brand" without knowing its tokens.

## `tokensUsed` is derived (#188)

A component that declares an `anatomy` **must not author `tokensUsed`** — the schema
rejects it. `build:meta` computes the list from the anatomy tree and injects it into
`design-system.json`, so the MCP and the doc generator see no difference.

This is the same single-sourcing as prop descriptions, which come from the JSDoc rather
than the meta. It became possible only once anatomy v2 could express every binding: with
29 tokens living solely in the flat list, there was nothing to derive from.

Verified as a pure deletion — the derived list reproduces all 27 previously hand-authored
lists **exactly**. Components without an anatomy keep authoring theirs until their
promotion batch lands.

## Anatomy v2 (#178 items 1–2)

Four keys and a richer condition grammar landed together, taking the count of tokens
declared in `tokensUsed` but attached to no part from **29 to zero** — which is what
unblocks deriving `tokensUsed` from anatomy (#188).

- **`radius`, `shadow`, `motion`** — mechanical additions. `motion` takes an array,
  because a transition binds a duration *and* an easing.
- **`focus`** — the focus indicator, bound **by role, not by the CSS that draws it**. The
  library draws focus rings three ways (`outline` in 7 components, `box-shadow` in 5,
  `border-color` in 3) for no design reason. Keying on the mechanism would need three keys
  and still couldn't answer *"does this component's focus indicator meet SC 1.4.11?"* —
  the question #29 exists to audit. This is the one deliberate abstraction over the CSS in
  anatomy; every other key transcribes literally. A `box-shadow` focus ring binds `focus`,
  not `shadow`; `shadow` means genuine elevation.
- **Compound conditions** — `when` takes an array of ANDed terms
  (`["variant=secondary", ":hover"]`). Every term is validated separately, so a typo in a
  non-leading term still fails the build.
- **Negation** — `!disabled`, `!checked`. Real selectors guard on absence: checkbox's hover
  rule is `:host(:not([disabled]):not([checked]):not([indeterminate])) …:hover`. Without
  negation it is inexpressible. `!disabled` does **not** earn the disabled contrast
  exemption — it asserts the opposite.

**A compound state refines, it does not restart.** `variant=secondary + :hover` cascades
over both `variant=secondary` and `:hover`, exactly as the CSS does. Composing it against
the resting set alone paired rr-button's hover background with its *resting* foreground —
1.23:1 for a combination that never renders — and failed the build on a defect that does
not exist. `effectiveTokens()` models the cascade instead.

Still deferred to #178 item 3: the ambient-surface model, and with it per-part non-text
(SC 1.4.11) checking. Adding the `focus` key does **not** create contrast pairs — anatomy
still derives text pairs only, and the pairing count is unchanged (40 with anatomy, 38
without, before and after v2). Checking a focus ring against what surrounds it needs to
know what the component sits *on*, which is precisely item 3.

## Commands

| Command | What it does | When it fails |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run parity` | Diffs every bound meta's bindings against `figma/components.dump.json` and classifies drift (see below). `--json` for machine output; pass a path to diff a different dump. | Exit 1 on any finding. |
| `npm run validate` | The build gate. Contract-relevant sections: **§1b** — every `rr-*` entry in a slot's `accepts` must name a real component; **§1c** — every anatomy state's `when` must name a declared prop; **§3b** — every anatomy token binding must resolve; **§4** — every `figma.enum` emission must exist in a component literal union; **§4b** — bindings must agree with the component's `*.figma.ts` bidirectionally (property name, full valueMap, reverse coverage); **§4c** — a prop's enum `valueMap` must match that prop's own literal union, and its declared `type` must be that union (#191); **§4d** — the contract's tokens must match the tokens the component's styles actually reference, both directions (#187); **§5** — every intended fg/bg pairing holds its contrast threshold. | Exit 1, offending item named. |
| `npm run build:meta` | Regenerates the CEM + `design-system.json` (bindings, `accepts`, `ignoredOptions` all flow through to the MCP's `get_component`). Commit the regenerated artifact — CI fails on staleness. | On schema violations or missing prop JSDoc. |

## Reading parity findings

Each finding is `[class] component: detail`, classified — never guessed:

- **`ahead`** — Figma has a variant axis or option that no binding and no
  `ignoredOptions` entry covers. Figma is ahead of the contract. → Either promote it
  (add to the binding's `valueMap` + implement in code) or declare it design-only
  (`ignoredOptions`). Both are reviewed changes to the meta.
- **`behind`** — a binding or ignore references a property/option the Figma
  component set no longer has (stale ignores included), or a bound meta has no
  matching component set in the dump. Figma is behind the contract. → Fix the Figma
  library (or the stale declaration) to match.
- **`mismatched`** — same axis on both sides, but an option exists on exactly one
  side (the historical `ghost`/`danger` drift, #46). Reported per option, with which
  side has it. → Decide which side is right, change the *contract* first, then the
  lagging surface.

The differ only reports. It never edits metas, code, or Figma.

## Refreshing the dump

The dump is a point-in-time export. To refresh (after changing the Figma library, or
when the weekly audit says it's stale):

1. For each bound component, take `figma.nodeId` from its meta
   (`96:21` badge, `98:56` button, `103:27` input today).
2. In a session with the **Figma MCP** connected: `get_metadata` on the file key
   `4aOEBHcnAv2Kbn0g1arL78` + that nodeId. The `<symbol name="Variant=…,State=…">`
   entries are the variant names — copy them verbatim into the component's
   `variants` array in `figma/components.dump.json`, update `exported`.
3. `npm run parity` — resolve any findings per the classes above before committing
   the refreshed dump.

(The Figma **variables** REST API is Enterprise-only, which is why exports go
through the MCP — same constraint and same pattern as `scripts/drift_audit.py`;
see the 2026-07-15 decision entry.)

## The weekly audit

A scheduled Claude Routine ("Parsimony component parity audit", Mondays 10:30 UTC)
re-exports the dump via the Figma MCP, runs the differ against the fresh export, and
reflects the result in one tracked GitHub issue — opened/updated with findings,
closed when clean. It never commits and never auto-fixes. **Caveat** (shared with
the drift-audit Routine): a Routine created from inside a session carries no MCP
connector grants — if its runs exit quietly, re-create it from the claude.ai
Routines UI with the Figma + GitHub connectors attached.

## Where this is heading

- **#156 stage 3** — the contract *generates* the surfaces: Figma library first,
  then the Lit components. From that point the differ's job flips from detecting
  drift to proving the generators faithful.
- Deferred slot-constraint scope (`acceptsMode`, `min`/`max` cardinality,
  per-surface anchors) is recorded on **#154**.
